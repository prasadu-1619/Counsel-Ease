    <h2>Types of Depression</h2>
   <div>Depression is a broad dysfunctional behavior. Presents with discouraged disposition, loss of certainty or absence of interest in delight, diminished energy, sentiments of regret or low energy, Self-worth, rest, or craving disturbed and powerless fixations. Furthermore, depression likewise happens with indications of tension. These issues might be gotten constant or repetitive and lead to huge debilitation of the person's ability to deal with their everyday obligations.</div><br>
   <div>Atypical depression- In typical mild, moderate, or severe depressive episodes, the patient suffers from lowering of mood, reduction of energy, and decrease in activity. Capacity for enjoyment, interest, and concentration is reduced, and marked tiredness after even minimum effort is common. Sleep is usually disturbed and appetite diminished. Self-esteem and self-confidence are almost always reduced and, even in the mild form, some ideas of guilt or worthlessness are often present. The lowered mood varies little from day to day, is unresponsive to circumstances and may be accompanied by so-called "somatic" symptoms, such as loss of interest and pleasurable feelings, waking in the morning several hours before the usual time, depression worst in the morning, marked psychomotor retardation, agitation, loss of appetite, weight loss, and loss of libido. Depending upon the number and severity of the symptoms, a depressive episode may be specified as mild, moderate or severe.</div><br>
   <div>Recurrent depressive disorder (RDD)- A disorder characterized by repeated episodes of depression as described for depressive episode, without any history of independent episodes of mood elevation and increased energy. There may, however, be brief episodes of mild mood elevation and overactivity immediately after a depressive episode, sometimes precipitated by antidepressant treatment. The more severe forms of recurrent depressive disorder have much in common with earlier concepts such as manic-depressive depression, melancholia, vital depression and endogenous depression. The first episode may occur at any age from childhood to old age, the onset may be either acute or insidious, and the duration varies from a few weeks to many months.</div><br>
<div>Psychotic depression or Depression with psychotic symptoms- An episode of depression, but with the presence of hallucinations, delusions, psychomotor retardation, or stupor so severe that ordinary social activities are impossible; there may be danger to life from suicide, dehydration, or starvation. The hallucinations and delusions may or may not be mood-congruent.</div><br>
<div>Perinatal/Post-partum Depression- People who just had pregnancy/post-labor face this sort of depression. Researches now suggest that even males can suffer from a diagnosis of perinatal or post-partum depression. An individual confronting this sort of depression must accept depression counselling from a reliable depression therapist as an initial step.</div>
